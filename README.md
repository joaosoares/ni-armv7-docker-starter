# NI cross-compiler starter with Docker, Conan and CMake
This is an example project that allows cross-compilation with the National Instruments tools for Linux hosts containerized in a docker image for ease-of-use. It also includes the Conan package manager and CMake for easier dependency handling.

## Quick start

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/joaosoares/ni-armv7-docker-starter
```

2. Add your code to the project. I recommend you use the `src` folder to keep things organized.
